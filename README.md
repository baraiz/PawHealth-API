**PawHealth Pro** is an enterprise-grade backend solution for comprehensive pet healthcare. Unlike standard registries, it features a **Smart Task Engine** that actively monitors nutrition and medical schedules to ensure proactive care.

## 🌟 Pro Features
- **🧠 Smart Task Engine**: Automatically generates a daily checklist (e.g., "Joey needs 50g more food today", "Rabies vaccine due this week").
- **🏥 Clinical Medical Records**: Detailed tracking of vet visits including summaries, diagnoses, and follow-up schedules.
- **🚨 Emergency SOS Registry**: Instant access to emergency veterinary contacts and chip identification.
- **📊 Real-time Health Analytics**: Aggregated insights into average feeding habits and weight trends.
- **🛡️ Data Integrity**: Strict Pydantic validation for all health metrics (Weight > 0, non-empty records).
- **⏱️ Performance Monitoring**: Integrated middleware logging request duration in milliseconds for high-frequency environments.

## 🏗 System Architecture
The project follows a modular architecture inspired by **Security Operations Centers (SOC)**, focusing on event logging and proactive alerting.
